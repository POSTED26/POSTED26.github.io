# About me
I have a degree in Computer Science but after graduation I took an IT role at a local non-profit. I provided customer support and helped build out their IT infrastructure. The switch to having an onsite IT support was massive and allowed me to better support staff and build out better security policies. As time went on the IT needs were being met and I was asked to become Data and Technology Director. This was a mix of handling our CRM, website and managing our data collection. As the company grows, data is becoming a more important part of what we do. How do you get funding without showing what you are actually accomplishing? Working on making sure we are collecting data that we actually need for funding and reports and making it accessible has been the biggest part of my job recently. Through all of this, I have realized that software engineering and data engineering is what I would really like to be doing. Making the transition has not been easy, a lot has changed since I graduated and adapting has been tough. My recent work with data has definitely influenced my interest in data engineering.

I started to write about my experiences while working on my projects. It is mostly about what I am working on, my takeaways, my thoughts and the challeges I face while working on projects.

## Projects
### [Sub Surface Light Scattering](https://github.com/POSTED26/SSSproject)
Using OpenGL and C++ I implemented a graphics technique to simulate light entereing a sphere and illuminating it from the inside.

I am working on a data pipeline where I take in Formula 1 data from openF1 API, clean and transform the data and load it into a Postgres database.
